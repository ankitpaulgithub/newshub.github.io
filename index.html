                A youth who died in Kerala’s Thrissur on Saturday had tested positive for monkeypox in another country,
                state Health Minister Veena George said. This would be India’s first monkeypox death and the fourth one
                outside Africa.
                <br>
                The 22-year-old, a native of Punniyoor in Thrissur, had died at a private hospital days after he
                returned from the UAE. Subsequently, the health department sent his samples to the Kerala unit of the
                National Institute of Virology in Alappuzha.
                <br><br>
                The minister said the youth had been diagnosed with monkeypox in a test conducted abroad, but his family
                members handed over the test results to the hospital authorities only on Saturday. “The youth had no
                symptoms of monkeypox. He had been admitted to the hospital with symptoms of encephalitis and fatigue.
                His relatives handed over the test result only on Saturday. A high-level probe would be held into the
                death as monkeypox has a very low fatality rate,” the minister added.
                <br><br>
                Sources with the health department said the youth had reached Kerala from the UAE on July 22. “He had
                been active after reaching home. He played football at a local ground. On July 26, he developed a fever
                and sought treatment at a local hospital, Later, he was shifted to another hospital where he had to be
                put on life support. He had claimed to have taken a test in the UAE before boarding the flight to
                Kerala,” the source said.

                All schools in Delhi are being roped into the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign. Schools, including private
                ones, have been directed to hoist the Tricolour atop their buildings from August 13 to August 15.

                The heads of all government and private schools in the city have been directed by the Delhi government’s
                education department to hoist the country’s national flag on their buildings during this period.
                <br><br>
                “To popularise the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ initiative and to ensure maximum public participation to make the
                programme a grand success, all government, aided and private schools and offices will launch a special
                ‘Information, Education, and Communication campaign’ for sensitisation and awareness of students,
                parents and staff with immediate effect,” said an official from the department.
                <br><br>
                The department has recommended all schools that they conduct special assemblies and awareness
                programmes, and has also recommended that school management committee (SMC) members be involved to
                “motivate the parents and people living in the vicinity”. Schools have also been encouraged by the
                department to organize “prabhat pheries” by students to encourage residents of nearby areas to also
                hoist the flag on their houses or buildings, conduct activities such as talks on the development of the
                design of the flag, patriotic songs, slogan writing and painting.
